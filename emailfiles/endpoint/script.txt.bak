[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a 
bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The 
lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop 
and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens 
again. The old man is now ahead of him.]

Cut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling 
papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He 
passes and he turns it back up again.

Cut to Samir. He grabs the steering wheel and shakes it in frustration.

SAMIR
Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass!! I just -

He hits the steering wheel.

Cut to Milton at a bus stop. TN

He mumbles his coming lines, as he does with all his lines.

MILTON
It's late again. If I'm there late again, I will be dismissed.

[Scene: Initech parking lot. Bill drives into his special spot. 
(Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche 
(license plate: MY PRSHE) and walks in. Peter walks in too.]

Cut to inside. Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch 
the metal handle. It gives him a shock and he enters.

Cut to the cubicles. Peter goes into his. He picks up papers, turns on 
the computer and sits down.

NINA
Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment.

(repeats that over and over)

Bill comes up to Peter.

BILL
Hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh… we have sort of a problem here. 
Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS 
reports.

PETER
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot.

BILL
MMMM..YEAH. YOU SEE, WE'RE PUTTING THE COVERSHEETS ON ALL TPS REPORTS 
NOW BEFORE THEY GO OUT. DID YOU SEE THE MEMO ABOUT THIS?

PETER
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just 
forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no 
problem.

BILL
Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, 
that will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another 
copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok?

He walks away.

PETER
Yeah, yeah, I've got the memo, I've got -

He picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle.

BILL
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

Peter tries to read his papers, but a loud radio (news) is bothering 
him. He stands up and sees it's Milton.

PETER
Milton? Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

MILTON
Uh, they said I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from 
nine to eleven while I'm collating….

PETER
But, no, no, no. I know you're allowed to, I was just thinking, like a 
personal favor, y'know?

MILTON
I, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while 
she' working, I can listen to the radio while I'm collating -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
So I don't see why -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
The radio, I can't -

PETER
Yeah! All right!

He sits down.
