Abandonment
In some cases, facilities may be abandoned, such as when pipelines get old and the facilities need upgrading or need to be removed and replaced with a new pipeline. Natural gas pipeline companies must get Commission approval before abandoning facilities or discontinuing services that are subject to FERC jurisdiction.

Congress has established that natural gas certificates and hydropower licenses issued by FERC also convey the power of eminent domain. Eminent domain is used as a last resort if a landowner and the project proponent cannot reach agreement on compensation for use or purchase of property required for the project. The project proponent is still required to compensate the landowner for the use or purchase of the property, and for any damages incurred during construction. However, the level of compensation would be determined by a court according to state law.
